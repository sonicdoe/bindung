> Helps you require your native Node.js addon.

`bindung` is a simpler and more modern alternative to
[`bindings`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-bindings).
It removes support for legacy paths, requires Node.js v4 or later, and
basically uses a simple `tryâ€¦catch` statement [as explained in the Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/addons.html#addons_building).

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install bindung --save
```

## Usage

Pass the `target_name`, as defined in your `binding.gyp`, to `bindung`.

```js
const addon = require('bindung')('addon')
```

## Differences to bindings

- Only tries `Release` and `Debug` build paths
  ([as opposed to `bindings`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-bindings/blob/v1.2.1/bindings.js#L18-L34))
- Looks for `binding.gyp` instead of `package.json`
  (therefore it works without `package.json` being present)
- Always appends `.node`
  ([as opposed to `bindings`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-bindings/blob/v1.2.1/bindings.js#L58-L61)),
  which means that you should not append `.node` yourself
- Requires Node.js v4 or later
